# Logistic-Regression

The best way to understand Machine Learning algorithms is to implement the code itself. In my Machine Learning class, after learning the algorithms, I decided in addition to Homework to implement the code by myself. It is important to understand the algorithms completely and know the mathematics behind them. In this file, I have implemented Logistic Regression from basics scratch.
